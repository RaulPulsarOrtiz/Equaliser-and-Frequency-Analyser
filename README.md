# Equaliser + Frequency-Analyser
Equalizer plugin based on a LPF, BPF and HPF. Created in JUCE framework.
The LPF and the HPF have a 'Frequency Cutoff' and a 'Slope' to choose how many dB per octave will be attenuated.
The parameters for the BPF are 'Central Frequency', 'Gain' and 'Q' to choose the bandwidth.
Moreover, there is a 'Graphic Frequency Analyser' which allows seeing the frequency spectrum that contains the audio given by the Host, and also allows you observe graphically which frequencies are being filtered or boosted/attenuated.
